This project involves building a basic network sniffer in Python that captures and analyzes network traffic. The goal is to understand how data flows on a network and how network packets are structured.

## Features

- Capture network packets on a specified network interface.
- Analyze and display IP source and destination addresses.
- Identify the protocol used (TCP/UDP).
- Display source and destination ports for TCP and UDP packets.

This project will help you gain practical knowledge of how network packets are constructed and how information is transmitted over a network.
